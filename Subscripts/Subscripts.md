# *Subscripts : 서브스크립트*

*Classes, structures, and enumerations can define subscripts, which are shortcuts for accessing the member elements of a collection, list, or sequence. You use subscripts to set and retrieve values by index without needing separate methods for setting and retrieval. For example, you access elements in an `Array` instance as `someArray[index]` and elements in a `Dictionary` instance as `someDictionary[key]`.*

*You can define multiple subscripts for a single type, and the appropriate subscript overload to use is selected based on the type of index value you pass to the subscript. Subscripts aren’t limited to a single dimension, and you can define subscripts with multiple input parameters to suit your custom type’s needs.*
