# *Type Casting*

*Type casting is a way to check the type of an instance, or to treat that instance as a different superclass or subclass from somewhere else in its own class hierarchy.*

*Type casting in Swift is implemented with the `is` and `as` operators. These two operators provide a simple and expressive way to check the type of a value or cast a value to a different type.*

*You can also use type casting to check whether a type conforms to a protocol, as described in [Checking for Protocol Conformance](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Protocols.html#ID283).*
