## *String Literals*

*You can include predefinedÂ `String`Â values within your code asÂ string literals. A string literal is a sequence of characters surrounded by double quotation marks (`"`).*

*Use a string literal as an initial value for a constant or variable:*

```swift
let someString = "Some string literal value
```

*Note that Swift infers a type ofÂ `String`Â for theÂ `someString`Â constant because itâ€™s initialized with a string literal value.*

### *Multiline String Literals*

*If you need a string that spans several lines, use a multiline string literalâ€”a sequence of characters surrounded by three double quotation marks:*

```swift
let quotation = """
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  "Where shall I begin,
please your Majesty?" he asked.

"Begin at the beginning," the King said gravely, "and go on
till you come to the end; then stop."
"""
```

*A multiline string literal includes all of the lines between its opening and closing quotation marks. The string begins on the first line after the opening quotation marks (`"""`) and ends on the line before the closing quotation marks, which means that neither of the strings below start or end with a line break:*

```swift
let singleLineString = "These are the same."
let multilineString = """
These are the same.
"""
```

*When your source code includes a line break inside of a multiline string literal, that line break also appears in the stringâ€™s value. If you want to use line breaks to make your source code easier to read, but you donâ€™t want the line breaks to be part of the stringâ€™s value, write a backslash (`\`) at the end of those lines:*

```swift
let softWrappedQuotation = """
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  "Where shall I begin, \
please your Majesty?" he asked.

"Begin at the beginning," the King said gravely, "and go on \
till you come to the end; then stop."
"""
```

*To make a multiline string literal that begins or ends with a line feed, write a blank line as the first or last line. For example:*

```swift
let lineBreaks = """

This string starts with a line break.
It also ends with a line break.

"""
```

*A multiline string can be indented to match the surrounding code. The whitespace before the closing quotation marks (`"""`) tells Swift what whitespace to ignore before all of the other lines. However, if you write whitespace at the beginning of a line in addition to whatâ€™s before the closing quotation marks, that whitespaceÂ isÂ included.*

![](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/multilineStringWhitespace_2x.png)

*In the example above, even though the entire multiline string literal is indented, the first and last lines in the string donâ€™t begin with any whitespace. The middle line has more indentation than the closing quotation marks, so it starts with that extra four-space indentation.*

### *Special Characters in String Literals*

*String literals can include the following special characters:*

- *The escaped special charactersÂ `\0`Â (null character),Â `\\`Â (backslash),Â `\t`Â (horizontal tab),Â `\n`Â (line feed),Â `\r`Â (carriage return),Â `\"`Â (double quotation mark) andÂ `\'`Â (single quotation mark)*

- *An arbitrary Unicode scalar value, written asÂ `\u{`n`}`, whereÂ nÂ is a 1â€“8 digit hexadecimal number (Unicode is discussed inÂ [Unicode](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/StringsAndCharacters.html#ID293)Â below)*

*The code below shows four examples of these special characters. TheÂ `wiseWords`Â constant contains two escaped double quotation marks. TheÂ `dollarSign`,Â `blackHeart`, andÂ `sparklingHeart`Â constants demonstrate the Unicode scalar format:*

```swift
let wiseWords = "\"Imagination is more important than knowledge\" - Einstein"
// "Imagination is more important than knowledge" - Einstein
let dollarSign = "\u{24}"        // $,  Unicode scalar U+0024
let blackHeart = "\u{2665}"      // â™¥,  Unicode scalar U+2665
let sparklingHeart = "\u{1F496}" // ðŸ’–, Unicode scalar U+1F496
```

*Because multiline string literals use three double quotation marks instead of just one, you can include a double quotation mark (`"`) inside of a multiline string literal without escaping it. To include the textÂ `"""`Â in a multiline string, escape at least one of the quotation marks. For example:*

```swift
let threeDoubleQuotationMarks = """
Escaping the first quotation mark \"""
Escaping all three quotation marks \"\"\"
"""
```

### *Extended String Delimiters*

*You can place a string literal withinÂ extended delimitersÂ to include special characters in a string without invoking their effect. You place your string within quotation marks (`"`) and surround that with number signs (`#`). For example, printing the string literalÂ `#"LineÂ 1\nLineÂ 2"#`Â prints the line feed escape sequence (`\n`) rather than printing the string across two lines.*

*If you need the special effects of a character in a string literal, match the number of number signs within the string following the escape character (`\`). For example, if your string isÂ `#"LineÂ 1\nLineÂ 2"#`Â and you want to break the line, you can useÂ `#"LineÂ 1\#nLineÂ 2"#`Â instead. Similarly,Â `###"Line1\###nLine2"###`Â also breaks the line.*

*String literals created using extended delimiters can also be multiline string literals. You can use extended delimiters to include the textÂ `"""`Â in a multiline string, overriding the default behavior that ends the literal. For example:*

```swift
let threeMoreDoubleQuotationMarks = #"""
Here are three more double quotes: """
"""#
```
