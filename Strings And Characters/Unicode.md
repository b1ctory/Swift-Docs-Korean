## *Unicode*

*Unicode is an international standard for encoding, representing, and processing text in different writing systems. It enables you to represent almost any character from any language in a standardized form, and to read and write those characters to and from an external source such as a text file or web page. Swift’s `String` and `Character` types are fully Unicode-compliant, as described in this section.*

### *Unicode Scalar Values*

*Behind the scenes, Swift’s native `String` type is built from Unicode scalar values. A Unicode scalar value is a unique 21-bit number for a character or modifier, such as `U+0061` for `LATIN SMALL LETTER A` (`"a"`), or `U+1F425` for `FRONT-FACING BABY CHICK` (`"🐥"`).*

*Note that not all 21-bit Unicode scalar values are assigned to a character—some scalars are reserved for future assignment or for use in UTF-16 encoding. Scalar values that have been assigned to a character typically also have a name, such as `LATIN SMALL LETTER A` and `FRONT-FACING BABY CHICK` in the examples above.*

### *Extended Grapheme Clusters*

*Every instance of Swift’s `Character` type represents a single extended grapheme cluster. An extended grapheme cluster is a sequence of one or more Unicode scalars that (when combined) produce a single human-readable character.*

*Here’s an example. The letter `é` can be represented as the single Unicode scalar `é` (`LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE`, or `U+00E9`). However, the same letter can also be represented as a pair of scalars—a standard letter `e` (`LATIN SMALL LETTER E`, or `U+0065`), followed by the `COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT` scalar (`U+0301`). The `COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT` scalar is graphically applied to the scalar that precedes it, turning an `e` into an `é` when it’s rendered by a Unicode-aware text-rendering system.*

*In both cases, the letter `é` is represented as a single Swift `Character` value that represents an extended grapheme cluster. In the first case, the cluster contains a single scalar; in the second case, it’s a cluster of two scalars:*

```swift
let eAcute: Character = "\u{E9}"                         // é
let combinedEAcute: Character = "\u{65}\u{301}"          // e followed by ́
// eAcute is é, combinedEAcute is é
```

*Extended grapheme clusters are a flexible way to represent many complex script characters as a single `Character` value. For example, Hangul syllables from the Korean alphabet can be represented as either a precomposed or decomposed sequence. Both of these representations qualify as a single `Character` value in Swift:*

```swift
let precomposed: Character = "\u{D55C}"                  // 한
let decomposed: Character = "\u{1112}\u{1161}\u{11AB}"   // ᄒ, ᅡ, ᆫ
// precomposed is 한, decomposed is 한
```

*Extended grapheme clusters enable scalars for enclosing marks (such as `COMBINING ENCLOSING CIRCLE`, or `U+20DD`) to enclose other Unicode scalars as part of a single `Character` value:*

```swift
let enclosedEAcute: Character = "\u{E9}\u{20DD}"
// enclosedEAcute is é⃝
```

*Unicode scalars for regional indicator symbols can be combined in pairs to make a single `Character` value, such as this combination of `REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER U` (`U+1F1FA`) and `REGIONAL INDICATOR SYMBOL LETTER S` (`U+1F1F8`):*

```swift
let regionalIndicatorForUS: Character = "\u{1F1FA}\u{1F1F8}"
// regionalIndicatorForUS is 🇺🇸
```
