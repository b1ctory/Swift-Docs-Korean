## *Substrings*

*When you get a substring from a string—for example, using a subscript or a method like `prefix(_:)`—the result is an instance of [`Substring`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/substring), not another string. Substrings in Swift have most of the same methods as strings, which means you can work with substrings the same way you work with strings. However, unlike strings, you use substrings for only a short amount of time while performing actions on a string. When you’re ready to store the result for a longer time, you convert the substring to an instance of `String`. For example:*

```swift
let greeting = "Hello, world!"
let index = greeting.firstIndex(of: ",") ?? greeting.endIndex
let beginning = greeting[..<index]
// beginning is "Hello"

// Convert the result to a String for long-term storage.
let newString = String(beginning)
```

*Like strings, each substring has a region of memory where the characters that make up the substring are stored. The difference between strings and substrings is that, as a performance optimization, a substring can reuse part of the memory that’s used to store the original string, or part of the memory that’s used to store another substring. (Strings have a similar optimization, but if two strings share memory, they’re equal.) This performance optimization means you don’t have to pay the performance cost of copying memory until you modify either the string or substring. As mentioned above, substrings aren’t suitable for long-term storage—because they reuse the storage of the original string, the entire original string must be kept in memory as long as any of its substrings are being used.*

*In the example above, `greeting` is a string, which means it has a region of memory where the characters that make up the string are stored. Because `beginning` is a substring of `greeting`, it reuses the memory that `greeting` uses. In contrast, `newString` is a string—when it’s created from the substring, it has its own storage. The figure below shows these relationships:*

> *NOTE*
> 
> *Both `String` and `Substring` conform to the [`StringProtocol`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/stringprotocol) protocol, which means it’s often convenient for string-manipulation functions to accept a `StringProtocol` value. You can call such functions with either a `String` or `Substring` value.*
