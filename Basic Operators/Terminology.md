## *Terminology*

*Operators are unary, binary, or ternary:*

- *Unary operators operate on a single target (such as `-a`). Unary prefix operators appear immediately before their target (such as `!b`), and unary postfix operators appear immediately after their target (such as `c!`).*

- *Binary operators operate on two targets (such as `2 + 3`) and are infix because they appear in between their two targets.*

- *Ternary operators operate on three targets. Like C, Swift has only one ternary operator, the ternary conditional operator (`a ? b : c`).*

*The values that operators affect are operands. In the expression `1 + 2`, the `+` symbol is an infix operator and its two operands are the values `1` and `2`.*
