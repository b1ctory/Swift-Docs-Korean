## *Custom Types*

*If you want to specify an explicit access level for a custom type, do so at the point that you define the type. The new type can then be used wherever its access level permits. For example, if you define a file-private class, that class can only be used as the type of a property, or as a function parameter or return type, in the source file in which the file-private class is defined.*

*The access control level of a type also affects the default access level of that type’s members (its properties, methods, initializers, and subscripts). If you define a type’s access level as private or file private, the default access level of its members will also be private or file private. If you define a type’s access level as internal or public (or use the default access level of internal without specifying an access level explicitly), the default access level of the type’s members will be internal.*

> *Important*
> 
> *A public type defaults to having internal members, not public members. If you want a type member to be public, you must explicitly mark it as such. This requirement ensures that the public-facing API for a type is something you opt in to publishing, and avoids presenting the internal workings of a type as public API by mistake.*

```swift
public class SomePublicClass {                  // explicitly public class
    public var somePublicProperty = 0            // explicitly public class member
    var someInternalProperty = 0                 // implicitly internal class member
    fileprivate func someFilePrivateMethod() {}  // explicitly file-private class member
    private func somePrivateMethod() {}          // explicitly private class member
}

class SomeInternalClass {                       // implicitly internal class
    var someInternalProperty = 0                 // implicitly internal class member
    fileprivate func someFilePrivateMethod() {}  // explicitly file-private class member
    private func somePrivateMethod() {}          // explicitly private class member
}

fileprivate class SomeFilePrivateClass {        // explicitly file-private class
    func someFilePrivateMethod() {}              // implicitly file-private class member
    private func somePrivateMethod() {}          // explicitly private class member
}

private class SomePrivateClass {                // explicitly private class
    func somePrivateMethod() {}                  // implicitly private class member
}
```
