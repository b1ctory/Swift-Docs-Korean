## Type Aliases

Any type aliases you define are treated as distinct types for the purposes of access control. A type alias can have an access level less than or equal to the access level of the type it aliases. For example, a private type alias can alias a private, file-private, internal, public, or open type, but a public type alias canâ€™t alias an internal, file-private, or private type.

> This rule also applies to type aliases for associated types used to satisfy protocol conformances.
