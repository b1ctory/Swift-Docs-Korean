### *Tuple Types*

*The access level for a tuple type is the most restrictive access level of all types used in that tuple. For example, if you compose a tuple from two different types, one with internal access and one with private access, the access level for that compound tuple type will be private.*

> *Note*
> 
> *Tuple types don’t have a standalone definition in the way that classes, structures, enumerations, and functions do. A tuple type’s access level is determined automatically from the types that make up the tuple type, and can’t be specified explicitly.*
