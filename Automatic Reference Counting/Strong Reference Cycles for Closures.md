## *Strong Reference Cycles for Closures*

*You saw above how a strong reference cycle can be created when two class instance properties hold a strong reference to each other. You also saw how to use weak and unowned references to break these strong reference cycles.*

*A strong reference cycle can also occur if you assign a closure to a property of a class instance, and the body of that closure captures the instance. This capture might occur because the closure’s body accesses a property of the instance, such as `self.someProperty`, or because the closure calls a method on the instance, such as `self.someMethod()`. In either case, these accesses cause the closure to “capture” `self`, creating a strong reference cycle.*

*This strong reference cycle occurs because closures, like classes, are reference types. When you assign a closure to a property, you are assigning a reference to that closure. In essence, it’s the same problem as above — two strong references are keeping each other alive. However, rather than two class instances, this time it’s a class instance and a closure that are keeping each other alive.*

*Swift provides an elegant solution to this problem, known as a closure capture list. However, before you learn how to break a strong reference cycle with a closure capture list, it’s useful to understand how such a cycle can be caused.*

*The example below shows how you can create a strong reference cycle when using a closure that references `self`. This example defines a class called `HTMLElement`, which provides a simple model for an individual element within an HTML document:*

```swift
class HTMLElement {

    let name: String
    let text: String?

    lazy var asHTML: () -> String = {
        if let text = self.text {
            return "<\(self.name)>\(text)</\(self.name)>"
        } else {
            return "<\(self.name) />"
        }
    }

    init(name: String, text: String? = nil) {
        self.name = name
        self.text = text
    }

    deinit {
        print("\(name) is being deinitialized")
    }

}
```

*The `HTMLElement` class defines a `name` property, which indicates the name of the element, such as `"h1"` for a heading element, `"p"` for a paragraph element, or `"br"` for a line break element. `HTMLElement` also defines an optional `text` property, which you can set to a string that represents the text to be rendered within that HTML element.*

*In addition to these two simple properties, the `HTMLElement` class defines a lazy property called `asHTML`. This property references a closure that combines `name` and `text` into an HTML string fragment. The `asHTML` property is of type `() -> String`, or “a function that takes no parameters, and returns a `String` value”.*

*By default, the `asHTML` property is assigned a closure that returns a string representation of an HTML tag. This tag contains the optional `text` value if it exists, or no text content if `text` doesn’t exist. For a paragraph element, the closure would return `"<p>some text</p>"` or `"<p />"`, depending on whether the `text` property equals `"some text"` or `nil`.*

*The `asHTML` property is named and used somewhat like an instance method. However, because `asHTML` is a closure property rather than an instance method, you can replace the default value of the `asHTML` property with a custom closure, if you want to change the HTML rendering for a particular HTML element.*

*For example, the `asHTML` property could be set to a closure that defaults to some text if the `text` property is `nil`, in order to prevent the representation from returning an empty HTML tag:*

```swift
let heading = HTMLElement(name: "h1")
let defaultText = "some default text"
heading.asHTML = {
    return "<\(heading.name)>\(heading.text ?? defaultText)</\(heading.name)>"
}
print(heading.asHTML())
// Prints "<h1>some default text</h1>"
```

> *Note*
> 
> *The `asHTML` property is declared as a lazy property, because it’s only needed if and when the element actually needs to be rendered as a string value for some HTML output target. The fact that `asHTML` is a lazy property means that you can refer to `self` within the default closure, because the lazy property will not be accessed until after initialization has been completed and `self` is known to exist.*

*The `HTMLElement` class provides a single initializer, which takes a `name` argument and (if desired) a `text` argument to initialize a new element. The class also defines a deinitializer, which prints a message to show when an `HTMLElement` instance is deallocated.*

*Here’s how you use the `HTMLElement` class to create and print a new instance:*

```swift
var paragraph: HTMLElement? = HTMLElement(name: "p", text: "hello, world")
print(paragraph!.asHTML())
// Prints "<p>hello, world</p>"
```

> *Note*
> 
> *The `paragraph` variable above is defined as an optional `HTMLElement`, so that it can be set to `nil` below to demonstrate the presence of a strong reference cycle.*

*Unfortunately, the `HTMLElement` class, as written above, creates a strong reference cycle between an `HTMLElement` instance and the closure used for its default `asHTML` value. Here’s how the cycle looks:*

*![](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/images/closureReferenceCycle01@2x.png)*

*The instance’s `asHTML` property holds a strong reference to its closure. However, because the closure refers to `self` within its body (as a way to reference `self.name` and `self.text`), the closure captures self, which means that it holds a strong reference back to the `HTMLElement` instance. A strong reference cycle is created between the two. (For more information about capturing values in a closure, see [Capturing Values](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/closures#Capturing-Values).)*

> *Note*
> 
> *Even though the closure refers to `self` multiple times, it only captures one strong reference to the `HTMLElement` instance.*

*If you set the `paragraph` variable to `nil` and break its strong reference to the `HTMLElement` instance, neither the `HTMLElement` instance nor its closure are deallocated, because of the strong reference cycle:*

```swift
paragraph = nil
```

*Note that the message in the `HTMLElement` deinitializer isn’t printed, which shows that the `HTMLElement` instance isn’t deallocated.*
