## *Resolving Strong Reference Cycles for Closures*

*You resolve a strong reference cycle between a closure and a class instance by defining a capture list as part of the closure’s definition. A capture list defines the rules to use when capturing one or more reference types within the closure’s body. As with strong reference cycles between two class instances, you declare each captured reference to be a weak or unowned reference rather than a strong reference. The appropriate choice of weak or unowned depends on the relationships between the different parts of your code.*

> *Note*
> 
> *Swift requires you to write `self.someProperty` or `self.someMethod()` (rather than just `someProperty` or `someMethod()`) whenever you refer to a member of `self` within a closure. This helps you remember that it’s possible to capture `self` by accident.*
