## *Setting a Default Property Value with a Closure or Function*

*If a stored property’s default value requires some customization or setup, you can use a closure or global function to provide a customized default value for that property. Whenever a new instance of the type that the property belongs to is initialized, the closure or function is called, and its return value is assigned as the property’s default value.*

*These kinds of closures or functions typically create a temporary value of the same type as the property, tailor that value to represent the desired initial state, and then return that temporary value to be used as the property’s default value.*

*Here’s a skeleton outline of how a closure can be used to provide a default property value:*

```swift
class SomeClass {
    let someProperty: SomeType = {
        // create a default value for someProperty inside this closure
        // someValue must be of the same type as SomeType
        return someValue
    }()
}
```

*Note that the closure’s end curly brace is followed by an empty pair of parentheses. This tells Swift to execute the closure immediately. If you omit these parentheses, you are trying to assign the closure itself to the property, and not the return value of the closure.*

> *NOTE*
> 
> *If you use a closure to initialize a property, remember that the rest of the instance hasn’t yet been initialized at the point that the closure is executed. This means that you can’t access any other property values from within your closure, even if those properties have default values. You also can’t use the implicit `self` property, or call any of the instance’s methods.*

*The example below defines a structure called `Chessboard`, which models a board for the game of chess. Chess is played on an 8 x 8 board, with alternating black and white squares.*

*![../_images/chessBoard_2x.png](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/_images/chessBoard_2x.png)*

*To represent this game board, the `Chessboard` structure has a single property called `boardColors`, which is an array of 64 `Bool` values. A value of `true` in the array represents a black square and a value of `false` represents a white square. The first item in the array represents the top left square on the board and the last item in the array represents the bottom right square on the board.*

*The `boardColors` array is initialized with a closure to set up its color values:*

```swift
struct Chessboard {
    let boardColors: [Bool] = {
        var temporaryBoard: [Bool] = []
        var isBlack = false
        for i in 1...8 {
            for j in 1...8 {
                temporaryBoard.append(isBlack)
                isBlack = !isBlack
            }
            isBlack = !isBlack
        }
        return temporaryBoard
    }()
    func squareIsBlackAt(row: Int, column: Int) -> Bool {
        return boardColors[(row * 8) + column]
    }
}
```

*Whenever a new `Chessboard` instance is created, the closure is executed, and the default value of `boardColors` is calculated and returned. The closure in the example above calculates and sets the appropriate color for each square on the board in a temporary array called `temporaryBoard`, and returns this temporary array as the closure’s return value once its setup is complete. The returned array value is stored in `boardColors` and can be queried with the `squareIsBlackAt(row:column:)` utility function:*

```swift

```
