# *Control Flow*

*Swift provides a variety of control flow statements. These include `while` loops to perform a task multiple times; `if`, `guard`, and `switch` statements to execute different branches of code based on certain conditions; and statements such as `break` and `continue` to transfer the flow of execution to another point in your code.*

*Swift also provides a `for`-`in` loop that makes it easy to iterate over arrays, dictionaries, ranges, strings, and other sequences.*

*Swift’s `switch` statement is considerably more powerful than its counterpart in many C-like languages. Cases can match many different patterns, including interval matches, tuples, and casts to a specific type. Matched values in a `switch` case can be bound to temporary constants or variables for use within the case’s body, and complex matching conditions can be expressed with a `where` clause for each case.*
