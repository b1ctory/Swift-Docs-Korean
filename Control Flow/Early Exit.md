## *Early Exit*

*A `guard` statement, like an `if` statement, executes statements depending on the Boolean value of an expression. You use a `guard` statement to require that a condition must be true in order for the code after the `guard` statement to be executed. Unlike an `if` statement, a `guard` statement always has an `else` clause—the code inside the `else` clause is executed if the condition isn’t true.*

```swift
func greet(person: [String: String]) {
    guard let name = person["name"] else {
        return
    }

    print("Hello \(name)!")

    guard let location = person["location"] else {
        print("I hope the weather is nice near you.")
        return
    }

    print("I hope the weather is nice in \(location).")
}

greet(person: ["name": "John"])
// Prints "Hello John!"
// Prints "I hope the weather is nice near you."
greet(person: ["name": "Jane", "location": "Cupertino"])
// Prints "Hello Jane!"
// Prints "I hope the weather is nice in Cupertino."
```

*If the `guard` statement’s condition is met, code execution continues after the `guard` statement’s closing brace. Any variables or constants that were assigned values using an optional binding as part of the condition are available for the rest of the code block that the `guard` statement appears in.*

*If that condition isn’t met, the code inside the `else` branch is executed. That branch must transfer control to exit the code block in which the `guard` statement appears. It can do this with a control transfer statement such as `return`, `break`, `continue`, or `throw`, or it can call a function or method that doesn’t return, such as `fatalError(_:file:line:)`.*

*Using a `guard` statement for requirements improves the readability of your code, compared to doing the same check with an `if` statement. It lets you write the code that’s typically executed without wrapping it in an `else` block, and it lets you keep the code that handles a violated requirement next to the requirement.*
