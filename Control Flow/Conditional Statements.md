## *Conditional Statements*

*It’s often useful to execute different pieces of code based on certain conditions. You might want to run an extra piece of code when an error occurs, or to display a message when a value becomes too high or too low. To do this, you make parts of your code conditional.*

*Swift provides two ways to add conditional branches to your code: the `if` statement and the `switch` statement. Typically, you use the `if` statement to evaluate simple conditions with only a few possible outcomes. The `switch` statement is better suited to more complex conditions with multiple possible permutations and is useful in situations where pattern matching can help select an appropriate code branch to exec*ute.
