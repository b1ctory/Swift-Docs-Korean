## *Floating-Point Numbers*

*Floating-point numbers are numbers with a fractional component, such as `3.14159`, `0.1`, and `-273.15`.*

*Floating-point types can represent a much wider range of values than integer types, and can store numbers that are much larger or smaller than can be stored in an `Int`. Swift provides two signed floating-point number types:*

- *`Double` represents a 64-bit floating-point number.*

- *`Float` represents a 32-bit floating-point* number.

> *NOTE*
> 
> *`Double` has a precision of at least 15 decimal digits, whereas the precision of `Float` can be as little as 6 decimal digits. The appropriate floating-point type to use depends on the nature and range of values you need to work with in your code. In situations where either type would be appropriate, `Double` is preferred.*
