## *Semicolons*

*Unlike many other languages, Swift doesn’t require you to write a semicolon (`;`) after each statement in your code, although you can do so if you wish. However, semicolons are required if you want to write multiple separate statements on a single line:*

```swift
let cat = "🐱"; print(cat)
// Prints "🐱"
```
